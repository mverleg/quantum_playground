Quantum computer playground
===============================

This is where I might do some experimentation with quantum computers, if I find the time.

I have some experience with quantum mechanics and with programming, but have never used the combination, so there will be mistakes.

This uses the nice `Rust Quantum package`_ to simulate a small quantum computer.
